### About

An ABV-IIITM educational initiative
Student Gyan Movement (An educational initiative led by the students of ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior. The mission is to teach 3rd to 12th class students, those who belonging to poor family background, free of cost).


### Mission
Our objective is to strengthen the educational system and uplift the quality of education in the government run schools and other small private schools of nearby slum-areas and support the poor students with better and improved infrastructure for their study. We started this initiative a year ago with some students from nearby rural and slum areas, by motivating them for higher study.

### Summary
In early stage we started the SGM with 6 students of class 10th, on 22nd February, 2012. These 6 students are from nearby area (Hazira). The student came at evening and we taught them in the evening after our M-Tech classes for 1 hour daily. In beginning we started with the basic subjects like: Maths, English and Science. At that time we observed that the basic knowledge of these students were not satisfactory, like: they were facing problems in English speaking and writing, their fundamentals in Maths and Science were not good enough. So we started finding reason behind that, and we got that, the schools where they were studying, had lack of facilities and better resources to teach, so the students were losing their interest to continue the education. Also due to lack of proper motivation, some of them were not continuing their education. After finding this, we first thought to motivate them for study, by teaching them with modern facilities and computer resources. Then we again visited to nearby areas and met other students of 10th and 12th class and told them about SGM. After few days we also started with class 12th student. We started teaching them basic subjects like Maths, Physics, Chemistry and English. So, In these 5 months, we added more number of 10’th and 12’th class students to SGM. Now we daily teach them for 2 hours (from 5.00 pm to 7.00 pm) in evening. In these days we covered a lot of syllabus and other sessions. Now We are getting a very good response from the students of SGM. The knowledge level and confidence of students is also satisfactory. Their interest level towards interactive learning is also high.
