    <p>I am happy to know the progress of SGM. Our student have done an excellent job in performing their role as member of society and carrying the mission of education. I wish SGM a grand success.</p>
    <p>Best of luck and warm wishes to Team SGM.</p>

    <p>Expressing pleasure in words is not possible when I observe the success of Student Gyan Movement in a very short span of time.  </p>
    <p>Being a social creature, every human being on the earth must understand his/her responsibility towards the society in which he/she lives. Understanding this philosophy, our students take the responsibility of educating some children who are relatively far from a good education system. They started the Student Gyan Movement in the ABV-IIITM campus with the vision of best education without any monetary cost.  </p>
    <p>Of course, Education is not the only problem with the country, there are several others, e.g. Large Population, Corruption, Terrorism etc. But I feel that the lack of education is the root of all such problems. Other problems may significantly be controlled in a well educated and well cultured society.   </p>
    <p>Our students of ABV-IIITM Gwalior are doing a commendable job for the society. Simultaneously, children and their parents are equally responsible for the success of the movement.  </p>
    <p>I feel proud to my students who are involved in the movement. I congratulate to all children attending classes here, for their good start towards a better life. </p>
    <p>I feel very close to the fulfilment of the dream that SGM team has seen. My best wishes are always with SGM.  </p>

                            <h2 class="clr-6 p6">Foundation of SGM</h2>
                            <p class="clr-6">We started STUDENT GYAN MOVEMENT on 22nd February, 2012. In the very beginning, when we use to go nearby areas of Hazira in Gwalior, we noticed that a lot of students were not going to schools. So we did a survey to figure out the reason. We came to know that there were lot of students either working or sitting at home just because of lack of proper guidance, motivation and may be way of teaching and lack of resources at schools. Another problem that we found was, often the student’s parents belonging to poor families did not know the importance of education. Their opinion is to send their child to work somewhere instead of studying and earn a bit. So we thought of providing them with not only their course study but also motivation to success in this competing world. We came up with the idea of interactive learning so that they can understand the things easily and keep their interest in it. We teach them here with the help of computers and projector. We are pleased with performance of students and we are expecting more than that. </p>

                            <h2 class="clr-6 p6">Summary</h2>
                            <p class="clr-6">In early stage we started the SGM with 6 students of class 10th, on 22nd February, 2012. These 6 students are from nearby area (Hazira). The student came at evening and we taught them in the evening after our M-Tech classes for 1 hour daily.
                                In beginning we started with the basic subjects like: Maths, English and Science. At that time we observed that the basic knowledge of these students were not satisfactory, like: they were facing problems in English speaking and writing, their fundamentals in Maths and Science were not good enough.
                                So we started finding reason behind that, and we got that, the schools where they were studying, had lack of facilities and better resources to teach, so the students were losing their interest to continue the education. Also due to lack of proper motivation, some of them were not continuing their education.
                                After finding this, we first thought to motivate them for study, by teaching them with modern facilities and computer resources. Then we again visited to nearby areas and met other students of 10th and 12th class and told them about SGM.
                                After few days we also started with class 12th student. We started teaching them basic subjects like Maths, Physics, Chemistry and English.
                                So, In these 5 months, we added more number of 10’th and 12’th class students to SGM. Now we daily teach them for 2 hours (from 5.00 pm to 7.00 pm) in evening. In these days we covered a lot of syllabus and other sessions. Now We are getting a very good response from the students of SGM. The knowledge level and confidence of students is also satisfactory. Their interest level towards interactive learning is also high.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="clr-6 p6">Future Plan</h2>
                            <p class="clr-6">In future, we are planning to extend the SGM on a larger level with more number of students and more better resources of interactive learning.</p>
